    "#### Differential Privacy for Kaplan-Meier Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Differential privacy is a technique used in the FCP to protect patient data by adding noise to query results. Like all FCP metrics, the Kaplan-Meier metric supports differential privacy, and you can configure the privacy enforcement level in your project settings. The default privacy level is \"Medium,\" but you can select from \"None,\" \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" or \"High\" according to your project's privacy requirements, whereas:\n",
    "\n",
    "None - No noise is added to any of the data.\n",
    "Low, Medium - Noise is partially added to the data. Times that less than k (anonymity threshold) events occur are aggregated and averaged across events occurring in adjacent times, and noise is then added to them.\n",
    "High - Noise is added to all of the time data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about configuring differential privacy settings, please refer to the project settings documentation."
